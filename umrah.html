You’ll hear, live, the glorious call to prayer from the famous muadhins, calling ‘Allahu Akbar, Allaaaahu Akbar’ as the sound of the adhaan echoes from the speakers and moves your soul and elevates your imaan. As you join the rows, lines straight and hearts upright, seeking to draw closer to Allah, standing before Him in humility and prayer, you realise, Allah has chosen you to be His Guest in this great journey of faith.</p>

            <p class="mazaratdesc">Join us as we relive some of the most defining moments in the history of Islam. Experience the DST difference with our immersive historical tour of Makkah delivered by expert guides that will transport you a prophetic era.
                A moving and inspiring story of seclusion and revelation, of prophethood and perseverance, it all starts with a trip to Jabal al Noor, the Mountain of Light, where the Prophet (ﷺ) first received revelation.
                
                Learn about the persecution faced by early Muslims and how they were driven out of Makkah whilst holding firmly onto their faith. Learn about the migration of the Prophet (ﷺ) and the remarkable occurrences at Jabal Thawr that instilled within the believers lessons of tawakkul, of absolute, unwavering reliance in Allah SWT.
                
                Visit the iconic Jabal Ar-Rahmah, the Mount of Mercy, whereupon the Prophet (ﷺ) delivered his famous last sermon and the site which forms the pinnacle of the rites of Hajj. Journey through Mina, the city of tents, where pilgrims follow the example of the Prophet and stay for several days during the Hajj and pelt the three Jamarat, symbolic of warding off the devil and rooted in the story of Ibrahim (عَلَيْهِ ٱلسَّلَامُ).
                
                For the ultimate experience, join us for our unique and exclusive ‘Walking Tour of AlMasjid AlHaram’, where we recount some of the most notable moments and places, delivered by our renowned expert guides.
